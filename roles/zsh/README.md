After executing zsh the first time:

The function will not be run in future, but you can run
it yourself as follows:
  autoload -Uz zsh-newuser-install
  zsh-newuser-install -f

The code added to ~/.zshrc is marked by the lines
# Lines configured by zsh-newuser-install
# End of lines configured by zsh-newuser-install
You should not edit anything between these lines if you intend to
run zsh-newuser-install again.  You may, however, edit any other part
of the file.
